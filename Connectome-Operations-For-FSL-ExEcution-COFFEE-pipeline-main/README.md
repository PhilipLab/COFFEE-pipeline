# Connectome Operations For FSL ExEcution (COFFEE) Pipeline  

Ben Philip in Occupational Therapy at Washington University created a fMRI processing pipeline to integrate HCP preprocessing (including Freesurfer) with FSL on the Mac, for analysis of task MRI data.

In the HCP/scripts directory are a number of bash programs that are modified versions of the HCP originals. Install the stock HCP v3.27 minimal processing pipeline (https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines/tree/v3.27.0) and insert the "scripts" directory.

Besides the elimination of the hard coded paths and file names expected in by the stock scripts, the structural pipeline can run without a T2w image and the resolution can be specified to be either 0.7mm, 0.8mm or 1mm.  The pipeline can be run with Freesurfer versions 7.2.0, 7.3.2 and 7.4.0 as well as 5.3.0-HCP.  The Freesurfer can be edited, and an option reruns just the necessary parts of the structural pipeline.

For the functional pipeline, besides the stock behavior of warping to the 2mm MNI atlas, scans can also remain in the native Glasser space. The phase encoding direction is read from the nifti's json file rather than assumed from the file name, and the set-up script (ie COFFEEfMRIpipeSETUP.sh) checks the phase encoding direction of the SBref's and field maps to ensure compatibility with the BOLD file. Intensity normalization to a global mean of 10000 is not performed (Glasser 2013). The necessary additional outputs are provided for modeling and analysis with the FSL FEAT GUI.  

Consider examples/10_2000_scanlist.csv. The first step is to create the driving file for the set-up scripts.  
&emsp;&emsp;% **scanlist2dat.py 10_2000_scanlist.csv**  
This will create examples/10_2000.dat. The functional and structural pipelines can then be created  
&emsp;&emsp;% **COFFEEstructpipeSETUP.sh 10_2000.dat -b 10_2000_batch.sh**  
&emsp;&emsp;% **COFFEEfMRIpipeSETUPT.sh 10_2000.dat -f 4 6 -p 60 -b 10_2000_batch.sh**  
This includes 4 and 6mm spatial smoothing along with a high pass filter with a 60s cutoff. Then run  
&emsp;&emsp;% **./10_2000_batch_fileout.sh**
